## **Introduction**

  Alien Invasion is a beginner-level project I built to learn Python and game development concepts. It’s based on the guidance from Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes and uses the Pygame library to create a fun and interactive game.
  In the game, players navigate their spaceship, shoot down aliens, and aim to survive as long as possible.


## **Features**

  Control the spaceship using the keyboard.  
  Fire bullets to destroy alien ships.  
  Increasing difficulty as more aliens appear.  
  Track your score and high score.  

## **Installation**  
To run this project, you’ll need Python and the Pygame library installed on your system.  

1. Clone this repository : https://github.com/karankarn/AlienInvasion.py.git
2. Navigate to Project Directory : cd alien-invasion
3. Install Library : pip install pygame
4. Run GAme : python alien_invasion.py  

## **Usage**  
Use the arrow keys to move your spaceship.  
Press the spacebar to shoot bullets.  
Survive and destroy as many alien ships as possible.  

## **Technologies Used**
