## **Introduction**

  Alien Invasion is a beginner-level project I built to learn Python and game development concepts. Itâ€™s based on the guidance from Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes and uses the Pygame library to create a fun and interactive game.
  In the game, players navigate their spaceship, shoot down aliens, and aim to survive as long as possible.


## **Features**

  Control the spaceship using the keyboard.  
  Fire bullets to destroy alien ships.  
  Increasing difficulty as more aliens appear.  
  Track your score and high score.
